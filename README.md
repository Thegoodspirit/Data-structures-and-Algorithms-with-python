# Data-structures-and-Algorithms-with-python

In this repositry we are going study some algorithms and some important inbuild function in python how they work like array , linklist , deque etc  and made them by on .

# DYNAMIC ARRAY IMPLIMENTATION 

In this we learn how dynamic array works and how the size of an array is modified by on. 

Note:-

DYNAMIC ARRAY :- A dynamic array is similar to an array, but with the difference that its size can be dynamically modified at runtime. 
Don't need to specify how much large an array beforehand. The elements of an array occupy a contiguous block of memory, and once created,
its size cannot be changed

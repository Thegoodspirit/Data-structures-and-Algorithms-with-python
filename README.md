# Data-structures-and-Algorithms-with-python

In this repositry we are going study some important algorithms and some important inbuild function in python and it functionality by build tham by on like array , linklist , deque etc.

# DYNAMIC ARRAY IMPLIMENTATION 

-> In this we learn how dynamic array works and how the size of an array is modified by on. 

-> Note:-

DYNAMIC ARRAY :- A dynamic array is similar to an array, but with the difference that its size can be dynamically modified at runtime. 
Don't need to specify how much large an array beforehand. The elements of an array occupy a contiguous block of memory, and once created,
its size cannot be changed

# STACK IMPLIMANTATION

-> A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. 

-> This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” 

-> The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”

-> This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out!

# QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION

-> A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.” 

-> As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.

-> The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. 

->The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. 

-> This ordering principle is sometimes called FIFO, first-in first-out. 

# DEQUE IMPLEMENTATION

-> Advertisements. A double-ended queue, or deque, has the feature of adding and removing elements from either end. The Deque module is a part of collections library. It has the methods for adding and removing elements which can be invoked directly with arguments.

# LINKLIST IMPLEMENTATION

-> A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes as discussed in the previous chapter. We have already seen how we create a node class and how to traverse the elements of a node. In this chapter we are going to study the types of linked lists known as singly linked lists. In this type of data structure there is only one link between any two data elements. We create such a list and create additional methods to insert, update and remove elements from the list.

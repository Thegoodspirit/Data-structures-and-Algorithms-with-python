# Data-structures-and-Algorithms-with-python

In this repositry we are going study some important algorithms and some important inbuild function in python and it functionality by build tham by on like array , linklist , deque etc.

# DYNAMIC ARRAY IMPLIMENTATION 

-> In this we learn how dynamic array works and how the size of an array is modified by on. 

-> Note:-

DYNAMIC ARRAY :- A dynamic array is similar to an array, but with the difference that its size can be dynamically modified at runtime. 
Don't need to specify how much large an array beforehand. The elements of an array occupy a contiguous block of memory, and once created,
its size cannot be changed

# STACK IMPLIMANTATION

-> A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. 

-> This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” 

-> The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”

-> This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out!
